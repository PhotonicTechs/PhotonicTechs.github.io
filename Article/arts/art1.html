There are so many planets we have discovered in our galaxy which lie in the habitable zone of<br>
their host star, but barely any of the discovered planets are Earth-like. If the planet is extremely large, it’s <br>
most likely a gas planet, if too small, the low gravity won’t be strong enough to hold an atmosphere, a <br>
planet without an atmosphere isn’t the most ideal environment for life. This is why searching for planets <br>
 having a similar radius to earth’s in the habitable zone is much more likely to be habitable for life than <br>   
looking for any planet in all sorts of sizes in the habitable zone. These following planets you see here <br>
may be habitable, but what makes Kepler 186f stand out is it being the first planet to be discovered <br>
having a similar radius to Earths in the habitable zone. This amazing discovery proved that there can be <br>
<img height="500" width="890" src="http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/Kepler186/Kepler186f.jpg"><br>
other earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, not just earth. Kepler 186f resides in the Kepler 186 <br>
system 557.7 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. Kepler 186f coexists among 4 other <br>
planets in its system. They are pretty close to their star to where they make a complete orbit in less than <br>
23 days but Kepler 186f orbits its star in 130 days because it’s further out in the habitable zone. Kepler <br>
186f is the second smallest planet in its system with a radius of 4,631.7 miles, estimated to be around 27 <br>
to 33 percent bigger than Earth's. It’s also believed to be at least 2 times the size of the earth. Now, just <br>

because this planet is in the habitable zone of its star, doesn’t mean it’s habitable. Since the planet is <br>
about 582 light-years away, we don’t know what it’s made up of. We aren’t even sure about its<br>
atmosphere and temperature. As you may know, the temperature of a planet is highly affected by just its<br>
 atmosphere. That’s why Venus is hotter than Mercury even though Mercury is closer to our sun; Venus has <br>
a thick atmosphere primarily made up of carbon dioxide, most radiation from our sun has a wavelength <br>
small enough to pass through the atmosphere, once the surface of the planet absorbs the energy that <br>
has passed through, it releases it up towards space in a form of thermal radiation with longer <br>
wavelengths than before. The atmosphere is now capable of absorbing some heat from the radiation <br>

since its larger wavelength makes it less opaque to the atmosphere. With Venus extremely thick <br>
atmosphere, no wonder why it’s so hot. Mercury, on the other hand, has a thin exosphere mostly made up <br>
of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium atoms blasted off the surface from solar winds and <br>
striking meteoroids which will hold in barely any heat from the sun. Now, imagine if Kepler 186f having <br>
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
an atmosphere like Venus. It won’t actually be scorching hot because it’s a lot further away from its star <br>
than Venus is from our star and Kepler 186 is an M-dwarf star with a radius size 48 percent smaller than <br>
our star and a surface temperature at around 2,023 Kelvins less than our star. If the planet has a rather <br>
thick atmosphere with high levels of carbon dioxide like Venus, it may be enough to warm the planet to <br>
where water can flow on its surface with temperatures just above 0 degrees Celsius for life to evolve <br>
under the right conditions. How about Mercury? Well, the planet’s temperature would be around its<br>
<img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-da46bca857ed5034391151bacff188b5" height="500" width="750"><br>
equilibrium temperature which is the surface temperature of a planet without an atmosphere. It is <br>
estimated to be around -85 degrees Celsius which is below freezing. With the planet in this state, it will <br>
not be able to support life. As you can tell, a planet’s atmosphere is extremely important in determining <br>
habitability. Now a planet’s axial tilt may seem irrelevant in this equation but it also plays a big part in <br>
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
finding a habitable planet. Earth has seasons because of our planets axis rotation is tilted at a pretty <br>           
consistent angle of 23.5 degrees year-round. This allows for different parts of our planet to vary in <br>
temperature through its full rotation cycle around our star giving our planet seasons. If a planet does not <br>
have an axis tilt, the planet's equator will always have the most amount of light while other parts of the <br>
planet will have the least amount of light. The temperature change in the regions of the planet will be <br>
very consistent if there aren’t any other season-changing influences like varied distance change from its <br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/0b/55/84/0b55848d42910cf32b2e1589ba2dcb58--science-lessons-science-fair.jpg" height="300" width="350"><br>
star as it rotates around. As you would expect, the closer you are to the star, the hotter the planet will be, <br>
the further, the colder. If Kepler 186f had no axial tilt, the only major temperature fluctuation it will <br>
experience is its distance change in orbiting its star. Fortunately, the probability of it being tidally locked <br>
is lower because tidal effects are much weaker on planets in a higher orbit. Another big mystery is Kepler<br>
 186f’s compositions. Since the planet’s diameter is somewhat similar to Earth’s, scientists believe it may <br>
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
also be a rocky planet since planets around this size are usually rocky in the habitable zone, but some <br>
research well after the discovery of Kepler 186f estimates earth-like planets in the habitable zone are <br>
possibly between 2 and 12 percent likely to be a rocky planet, but much more data is needed for a much <br>
more accurate estimation. Even if it were a rocky planet, if it doesn’t have similar compositions as Earths, <br>
this may or may not be a big problem depending on what’s missing. There are plenty of elements our <br>
planet has that life doesn’t need to survive so a bit of uniqueness is fine. Since there are many unknown <br>

things about this planet, the chances of all of these vital requirements being met feels unlikely to me <br>
personally, so I doubt this planet will be habitable, but with a great thick atmosphere with plenty <br>
enough carbon dioxide to hold in enough heat so that the temperature can be above 0 degrees Celsius, a <br>
reasonable axial tilt, and being a rocky planet with essential compositions including water, this planet <br>
may absolutely be habitable for life. Even though there are other planets claimed to be more earth-like <br>
than Kepler 186f in the habitable zone, it will always be remembered as the first Earth-sized exoplanet <br>
found in the goldilocks zone.<br>
